# Technical Project Portfolio
Welcome! 👋🏼 

This is my repository for technical projects I've worked on during my time at UC Berkeley 🧸

Because this is educational material belonging to course staff, some parts might be omitted for the sake of plagirism 🚧

If you'd like a more in-depth view into my work, feel free to reach out at louieortiz [at] berkeley [dot] edu 👨🏽‍💻
