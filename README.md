# Technical Project Portfolio 👨🏽‍💻
Welcome! This is my repository for technical projects I've worked on during my time at UC Berkeley. Because this is educational material belonging to course staff, some parts might be omitted for the sake of plagirism.

If you'd like a more in-depth view into my work, feel free to reach out at louieortiz [at] berkeley [dot] edu :-)
